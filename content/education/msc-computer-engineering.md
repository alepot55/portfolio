## Why Politecnico di Milano

After graduating cum Laude from Sapienza, I chose Polimi for its strong focus on systems engineering and its proximity to the European AI research ecosystem. The MSc program offered exactly what I needed: depth in machine learning theory combined with hands-on high-performance computing.

## Focus Areas

My coursework and research concentrate on:

- **Deep Learning & Representation Learning** — advanced architectures, training dynamics, and generalization theory
- **Computer Vision & 3D Reconstruction** — building on my bachelor's thesis work with Gaussian Splatting
- **High-Performance Computing** — GPU acceleration, distributed training, kernel optimization (Triton, CUDA)
- **Systems Design** — scalable architectures for ML inference and training pipelines

## Thesis

My thesis work is within the EU **Perivallon** Horizon Europe project, focusing on deep learning for satellite imagery analysis. The research involves developing efficient neural architectures for environmental monitoring from remote sensing data.

## Achievements During the Program

- **Merit-Based Scholarship** awarded for outstanding academic performance (GPA and credits)
- **3rd Place** in the Artificial Neural Networks Challenge (AIRLab) — ranked 3rd out of 193 teams with a custom Vision Transformer ensemble for medical image classification
- Active participant in the AI research community at Polimi's AIRLab

## What I'm Building

The courses gave me the theoretical foundation; the projects are where it comes together. Flash-Reasoning, Flash-SAE, and the GPU performance research all emerged directly from concepts learned in the HPC and deep learning courses, applied to real problems in AI infrastructure.
