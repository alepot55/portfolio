## The Foundation

Sapienza gave me a rigorous grounding in computer engineering fundamentals: from transistors to operating systems, from data structures to distributed systems. The curriculum was broad by design — and that breadth turned out to be invaluable.

## What I Studied

The core areas spanned the full stack:

- **Algorithms & Data Structures** — complexity theory, graph algorithms, dynamic programming
- **Computer Architecture** — CPU pipelines, cache hierarchies, memory systems
- **Operating Systems** — process scheduling, virtual memory, file systems, concurrency
- **Database Systems** — relational algebra, SQL optimization, transaction isolation
- **Signal Processing & Control** — the mathematical foundations that later proved essential for computer vision

## The Turn Toward AI

In my second year, I took introductory ML courses and was immediately drawn to the intersection of systems and intelligence. I started exploring deep learning independently, which led to opportunities in the AI/ML lab as a research assistant.

## Thesis: SplatSLAM

My thesis research pioneered real-time 3D reconstruction using Gaussian Splatting for SLAM pipelines. The project involved:

- Adapting Nerfstudio's offline rendering pipeline into a real-time incremental system
- Implementing photometric tracking for camera pose estimation
- Evaluating the system on indoor dynamic sequences

This work was developed within Sapienza's **Honors Program** (top 1% of students) and directly led to my interest in GPU kernel optimization.

## Graduating

I graduated with **110/110 cum Laude** (highest distinction). The experience at Sapienza was defined by two things: the rigor of the engineering curriculum and the freedom to explore AI research alongside it. Both shaped everything I've done since.
