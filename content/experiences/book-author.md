## The Project

I was commissioned by Neldiritto Editore to author a comprehensive Computer Science textbook aimed at candidates preparing for Italian public administration competitive exams (*Concorsi Pubblici*).

The challenge was unique: distill complex technical topics — Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Algorithms, Networking, Databases — into chapters that are both **technically rigorous** and **accessible to non-specialists**. The target readers aren't CS students; they're professionals who need to understand computing fundamentals well enough to pass a competitive exam.

## The Approach

Each chapter follows a deliberate structure:

- **Core concept** explained from first principles, without assuming prior knowledge
- **Progressive depth** that builds from intuition to technical precision
- **Exam-oriented practice** with worked examples and common pitfalls

The hardest part was calibrating the level: too technical and you lose the audience, too simplified and you produce incorrect mental models. I drew heavily on my teaching experience — 800+ hours of mentoring taught me where people actually get stuck, which is rarely where textbooks assume they will.

## Topics Covered

- Computer Architecture (von Neumann model, CPU pipelines, memory hierarchy)
- Operating Systems (process management, scheduling, memory management, file systems)
- Algorithms and Data Structures (complexity analysis, sorting, graphs, dynamic programming)
- Networking fundamentals (OSI/TCP-IP models, protocols, security basics)
- Database Systems (relational model, SQL, normalization, transactions)

## Current Status

The book is currently in progress, with manuscript delivery expected for 2025 publication.
