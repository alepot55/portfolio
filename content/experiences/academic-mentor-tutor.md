## What I Do

Since February 2022, I've delivered over **800 hours** of one-on-one and small-group mentorship to university students in Computer Science and Engineering. The subjects span Machine Learning, Python programming, Algorithms, Data Structures, and thesis-level research guidance.

Beyond tutoring, I act as a **Technical Lead** for thesis projects — helping students design architectures, debug complex systems, and develop the technical judgment that courses alone don't teach.

## How I Teach

My approach is built on a simple observation: students don't fail because the material is hard. They fail because they're missing a prerequisite concept that nobody identified, or because they have a subtly wrong mental model that makes everything downstream confusing.

So I start by **diagnosing the actual gap**, not the apparent one. A student struggling with backpropagation might actually need a refresher on the chain rule. A student stuck on concurrent programming might have a flawed model of what threads share.

Once the real gap is identified, I use **progressive problem solving**: start with a problem that's just barely within reach, solve it together, then incrementally add complexity. This builds both competence and confidence.

## Impact

Over four years, this work has produced:

- **800+ hours** of specialized mentorship delivered
- Students across Sapienza, Politecnico di Milano, and other Italian universities
- Thesis projects in machine learning, computer vision, distributed systems, and GPU computing
- A deep understanding of how people learn technical material — which directly informs my book authoring and my own study approach

## Why I Do This

Teaching is the best way to solidify your own understanding. Every student who asks "but *why* does it work this way?" forces me to examine assumptions I'd stopped questioning. The mentoring has made me a significantly better engineer.
